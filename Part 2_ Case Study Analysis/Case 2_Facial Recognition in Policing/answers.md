# Facial Recognition in Policing: Ethical Case Study Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive ethical analysis of facial recognition technology deployment in law enforcement, with particular focus on algorithmic bias that disproportionately affects minority communities. The analysis examines real-world bias scenarios, quantifies potential impacts, and provides evidence-based policy recommendations for responsible AI deployment.

## üö® Key Findings

- **Bias Disparity**: Facial recognition systems show false positive rates of 34.7% for Black women vs. 0.8% for white men
- **Systemic Impact**: Minority communities face up to 43x higher risk of misidentification
- **Policy Gap**: Current regulatory frameworks are insufficient to address these disparities
- **Urgent Need**: Immediate intervention required to prevent civil rights violations


## üéØ Objectives

1. **Quantify Bias**: Measure and visualize algorithmic bias across demographic groups
2. **Assess Risks**: Identify ethical, legal, and social risks of biased systems
3. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Map impact and influence of affected parties
4. **Policy Recommendations**: Provide actionable solutions for responsible deployment
5. **Implementation Guide**: Offer practical roadmap for reform
