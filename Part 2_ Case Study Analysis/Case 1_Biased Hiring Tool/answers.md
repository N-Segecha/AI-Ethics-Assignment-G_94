## 🔍 Background

Amazon's AI recruiting tool, developed to streamline hiring processes, was discovered to systematically discriminate against female candidates. The system:

- Downgraded resumes containing words like "women's" (e.g., "women's chess club captain")
- Penalized graduates from all-women's colleges
- Showed systematic bias against female applicants across various technical roles
- Reflected historical male-dominated hiring patterns in its training data

This case study analyzes the root causes of this bias and provides practical solutions for building fair AI hiring systems.
