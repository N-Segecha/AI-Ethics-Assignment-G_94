# Ethical AI Use in Healthcare Guideline

## 1. Patient Consent Protocols
- *Informed Consent:* Patients must be clearly informed when AI is used in their diagnosis, treatment planning, or care management. This includes explaining the AI's role, capabilities, limitations, and associated risks.
- *Voluntary Participation:* Consent to use AI-based tools must be obtained without coercion. Patients should retain the right to opt out and request human-only review at any stage.
- *Data Use Authorization:* Explicit consent must be secured before using a patientâ€™s data to train or improve AI systems. Reuse of data for purposes beyond direct care requires separate authorization.

## 2. Bias Mitigation Strategies
- *Diverse Data Sets:* AI models must be trained and tested on diverse, representative datasets that reflect the patient population across age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
- *Fairness Audits:* Routine audits must be conducted to detect, report, and reduce disparities in AI performance across demographic groups.
- *Human Oversight:* Clinical professionals must review AI-generated outputs, especially in high-stakes decisions, to guard against biased or inaccurate recommendations.

## 3. Transparency Requirements
- *Explainability:* AI tools deployed in healthcare must be explainable. Clinicians and patients should understand how key recommendations or risk scores are generated.
- *Disclosure:* Institutions must disclose the use of AI technologies in patient care settings, including the name of the tool, developer, and regulatory status.
- *Accountability:* Clear governance structures should define who is responsible for outcomes resulting from AI-assisted decisions. Continuous documentation of AI performance and updates must be maintained.

# Note: These guidelines aim to align AI use with core healthcare values: respect for persons, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.
